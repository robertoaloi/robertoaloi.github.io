I wanted to translate <a href="http://torto45.wordpress.com/2010/10/29/hello-world/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> into English, cause I believe it renders an almost perfect picture of Italy as it is today. This is a free translation and all the rights for the original blog post belong to the original author.

When I was a child, I was told:

> "Study, or you’ll go nowhere."

So I’ve studied.

After completing my academic career, I’ve been told:

> "Why did you spend so much time on a degree? Don’t you know that’s a useless piece of paper? You’d better to learn a trade."

I’ve learned a trade. Then, I’ve been told:

> "What a shame. You’ve studied so many years for that trade?”

I moved ahead, and I left my job. I became penniless.

_One day I was too young and inexperienced. The day after I was too old, with too much experience and too many titles._

I finally found a job. Well, not a permanent one. A temporary one, with no paid leave, no insurance, no pension, no bonuses, no severance, no rights. And I had to fight hard to keep that not-a-job. I decided not to have children, because of some sense of responsibility, and I grew up. Then I’ve been told, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1289005/Rise-bamboccioni-big-babies--Why-young-Italians-choosing-live-home.html" target="_blank">by someone who got his job in the 60s, when it was easy to get a job, despite of your education level</a>:

> “You are a fool, a dupe who didn’t want to grow up and raise a family".

In the meantime, I was paying his very own pension, saying a final goodbye to mine. Tired and grown up, I decided to have a baby. I’ve been told that:

> “Only an irresponsible person would have a child without a proper job and without a good economical background”.

Given that I could not kill my son, I decided to emigrate. I went somewhere else. I found a safe place, and a good job. I was feeling good. I was feeling home. But one day, when the Italian system went bankrupt, I’ve then been told:

> “Why the hell did you flee? Why didn’t you help your Country?”.

At that point, There was only one very reply:

> “Fuck off!”.
