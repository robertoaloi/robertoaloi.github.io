For the third year in a row, Erlang Solutions will be present at Codemotion, one of the biggest IT conferences in Italy which focuses on innovative programming languages.This year, we propose a one day hands-on workshop on the Erlang programming language. I will hold the workshop in Rome on the 20th March. The workshop is titled"Erlang: multi-core and massive scalability" and it consists of a practical overview of the Erlang programming language.
